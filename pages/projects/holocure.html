              <span>HoloCure is a roguelike game where you pick up items and weapons that can be combined to create strong upgrades. The issue with roguelike games is that you don't know what you'll find, so you don't know what you should focus on obtaining. Attempting to use the wiki to see items results in a long list of items, not showing how to create them, or see if theres conflicts.</span>

              <span>My site manages many different factors. First, it displays all items and weapons directly to the user. This way the user can easily pick and choose their loadout. As the user selects their loadout though, certain items will become grayed out as they are no longer obtainable. The header shows the current build similar to the original game.</span>

            <span>HoloCure is a game created by Kay Yu and is a game based on the Japanese virtual idol company Hololive. The game is a stage or endless roguelike where you collect items and weapons as you play to make your character stronger. One of the hardest parts of playing is knowing what all the items do, and which ones work together.</span>

            <span>The power of this planner is it's responsive. You can select items that you want to use, and the page will update to show selection and disable items that would no longer be obtainable. This took a significant amount of time to implement in spreadsheets as you need to check how many items the player has, what items are already being used, etc.</span>

            <span>While I love creating projects in Google Sheets as it allows very quick data aggregation and prototyping, it's undeniable that the UI and ease of access are limited. Currently users must make a copy of the sheet to their personal drive account to use it. The UI also cannot be easily adjusted or built as it must follow Google Sheet's formatting restrictions. End users wanting to add their own features will also struggle as behind the scenes there are hundreds of cells with equations to create the end product (See above).</span>

            <span>In the future I want to move this project from Google Sheets to a website where I can take control over the UI design and how the user interacts with items. Currently I feel the project is awesome within the limitation of Google Sheets, however being able to create cells, dynamically adjust their positions, and select items without a checkbox would allow for a far superior user interface.</span>
