              <span>First generation students (FGS) at UC campuses face unique challenges including social, financial, and educational barriers, as well as internal struggles like guilt, stress, and perfectionism. These factors hinder their academic success and emotional well-being. After performing a review of current research in the field, we found it was the perfect opportunity to dive deeper.</span>

              <span>We conducted a 3 month long research study where we interviewed 3 first generation students at UC campuses to explore their experiences with academic, social, and emotional challenges. This produced a 14 page paper highlighting areas of focus in which the UC system could better support first generation students.</span>

            <span>Working with only one research partner during this 3 month study, we both shared in many of the tasks. We began by creating unique open ended qualitative research questions that would not induce bias in our interviewees. Next, we interviewed them over Zoom, following all ethical requirements needed for a class based research project. Afterwards, we hand transcribed the interviews from text using orthographic transcription and noted pauses. Lastly, we drew results from our data and created a 14 page paper along with presenting our findings to 40 of our peers.</span>
