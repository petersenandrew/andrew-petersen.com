          I’m a detail-oriented professional with a B.A. in Psychology from UC Santa Cruz, where I graduated Cum Laude. Currently, I work as a Service & Engagement Team Leader at Target, managing a team of 40 team members to drive operational performance and improve customer satisfaction. I’ve been recognized with multiple awards, including the Store Hourly Performance Award, for my leadership and problem-solving skills.

          In addition to my role at Target, I’m the Content Manager for KimaroArt Media, where I’ve helped grow total streams from 1,000 to over 350,000. I specialize in content strategy, analytics, and research to enhance audience engagement. In my free time I’m actively working on UI/UX design projects, honing my skills in user experience design and building my own websites to expand my technical expertise.

          Outside of work, I enjoy video editing, hiking, driving, working on cars, building computers, and calibrating monitors. If you'd like to connect about work or share similar interests, feel free to email me!
