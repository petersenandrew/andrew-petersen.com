## Background
The goal of this site is to create a visually appealing portfolio while gaining practice in UI/UX design. Once completed, I plan to feature it as a portfolio item itself.

I’ve always felt that traditional paper resumes don’t really capture everything I want to share. Plus, many websites just don’t present my content and work the way I envisioned it. That’s why I decided to create a site that blends the simplicity of a single page scrolling webpage with the creative elements of UI/UX design.

## Technologies Used
- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that transforms plain text into static websites.
  - Jekyll enables me to create multiple pages with consistent headers without needing to edit each one individually. It also supports permalinks, allowing for clean URLs like `mysite.com/resume`.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive front-end framework for developing visually appealing and mobile-friendly websites.
  - Bootstrap gives me a solid set of UI elements and supports mobile design right out of the box. This makes it easier and faster for me to build my site. This framework helps streamline the process so I don't spend hours stuck debugging.

## Installation
- Bootstrap Version: `4.4.1`
```
